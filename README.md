# MileApp-TextCase

There will be 3 main ipynb notebooks that handle the data given for this assessment. The first notebook is we try to understand the data more and try to find some insight using data visualization, the second notebook is about preprocessing our data to make it more suitable for machine learning use, and the third notebook is about implementing a machine learning solution using the given data.

There is also a Tableau File that holds a visualization of a Map using the longitude and latitude from the data. In the tableau file there will be some visualization that is similar towards the visualization that is presented in this notebook, but non the less i will use the visualization generated by the first notebook except for the Map visualization.

All of the main process my work will also be supported with a presentation slide in PDF file format, the content of the slide will be similar to the content of these notebooks.
